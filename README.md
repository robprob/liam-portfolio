Hello there! Here is where I demonstrate my learned skills through a variety of data projects.

## :snake: Python
| Project | Skills Demonstrated | Libraries | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| :spaghetti: [Tasty Bites](https://github.com/robprob/tasty-bites) | Business Presentation, Machine Learning, Data Validation/Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, scikit-learn | This project was completed for [certification](https://github.com/robprob/tasty-bites/blob/main/Professional-Data-Scientist-Certification.pdf) as a Professional Data Scientist through DataCamp. Simulating a real-world data job, I was provided data from a recipe website, "Tasty Bites", tasked with correctly predicting popular recipes to increase revenue. I presented my findings and a trained machine learning model to the customer, meeting and exceeding their expectations. |
| :panda_face: [Pandas Workout (My Solutions)](https://github.com/robprob/pandas-workout) | Data Wrangling, Programming, Time Series Analysis, Text Manipulation, Visualization, Memory & Performance | pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn| <a href='https://www.manning.com/books/pandas-workout'><i>Pandas Workout</i></a> by Reuven Lerner contains over 200 data analytics exercises. Starting from the very basics to more advanced topics, I completed every exercise in this >400 page book.

| :memo: [Data Professionals Survey Dashboard](https://github.com/robprob/data-professionals-survey) | Data Cleaning, Exploratory Analysis, Visualization | Python (pandas), Power Query, Power BI | Using data from a Data Professionals Survey conducted by [AlexTheAnalyst](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/Power-BI/blob/main/Power%20BI%20-%20Final%20Project.xlsx), I cleaned and extrapolated meaningful results to display using a fully customizable and interactive dashboard. This allows me to filter and display outcomes such as differences in educational levels and salaries for data professionals across various demographics to extrapolate meaningful results as to how the job-market and job-satisfaction varies for different individuals. |
